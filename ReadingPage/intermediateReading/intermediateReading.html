        <p> Hi ! <br><br>
            I took your advice, Mum, and talked 
            to the doctor here at the university 
            about my earache today. He asked if 
            I have headaches, too, but that isn't 
            the problem. Anyway, I've got some medicine
            so that's good. He said I shouldn't go 
            swimming at the moment. I'm not feeling 
            happy about that but I went for a long ride 
            on my bike yesterday instead. And something 
            funny happened yesterday. Some friends and 
            I were studying in the library when someone 
            started shouting outside the window. A woman 
            saw a snake! Anyway, they came and took it 
            to the zoo. We heard later it wasn't a dangerous
            one! Everything else is fine. I have to stop 
            now because I haven't got much time. 
            I've got to find out about Eric Shipton, you 
            know the famous explorer, before tomorrow 
            morning. See you at the weekend. My friend Jamie 
            wants to come, too. Is that OK? We shouldn't 
            study ALL the time! <br><br>
